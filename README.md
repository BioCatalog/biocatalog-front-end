# Welcome to our project BioCatalog

The BioCatalog is a project in development created for biologits and any other user that want to register and create catalogues for species of eatable plants.

As we are developing yet, it is not with all features, but it is the MVP, so feel free to test and use.

For this we used [Expo](https://expo.dev) with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app) and Gluestack-Ui.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

## Who we are?

We are students of Fatec Indaiatuba College and this is our interdisciplinar project.
